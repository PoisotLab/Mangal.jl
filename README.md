This package is a wrapper around the *new* API for the mangal ecological
interactions database. It uses [Julia 1.1][jl] to provide a programmatic
interface to *read* the data. Development of this package and the underlying
database was funded by the [Canadian Foundation for Innovation][cfi] and
[NSERC][nserc].
